Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017. In this challenge I will build the back end for an e-commerce site. I will take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
